Questions:
1. What is method_missing and how can it be used?
method_missing is a Hook. You can use it to handle calls to methods that are missing from a class. If you don't handle some cases then you should pass on the call using super.

2. What is and Eigenclass and what is it used for? Where Do Singleton methods live?
Eigenclass is another name for a singleton class. Singleton methods live in eigenclasses. 

3. When would you use DuckTypeing? How would you use it to improve your code?
You could use ducktypeing to write one method that would take a string or a file as an argument. It can help make code more reusable. Instead of writing one method that alphabetizes the words in a file and one that alphabetizes the words in a string, you can use the same method to do both. 

4. What is the difference between a class method and an instance method? What is the difference between instance_eval and class_eval?
A class method can be called without creating an instance of the class. You must have an instance of the class (an object) to call an instance method. 

class_eval sets self as if you're in the body of the class definition. instance_eval sets self as if you'r in the singleton class of self. The result is that if you're defining a method, use class eval_to define instance methods, and use instance_eval to define class methods. 

5. What is the difference between a singleton class and a singleton method?
A singleton method is a method that is defined only for a particular object. A singleton class is the class that's created when you define a singleton method. The singleton class is the superclass of the object that has the singleton method.
