Questions:
1. What is method_missing and how can it be used?
#method_missing returns a boolean value based on if a specific method exists for given object.
It can be patched to create methods at run time.

2. What is and Eigenclass and what is it used for? Where Do Singleton methods live?
An Eigenclass is an anonymous SuperClass.  Class methods are really just Eigenclasses!  They are referenced in their own singleton class.

3. When would you use DuckTypeing? How would you use it to improve your code?
Ducktyping is used when the type of object you are using isn't necessary to the code you are producing.
It is very valuable for reusing objects and building flexible code.

4. What is the difference between a class method and an instance method? What is the difference between instance_eval and class_eval?
A class method is called from a singleton class and an instance method is from the class itself and derived from an instanciated object.
#instance_eval help builds class based methods (instance methods) and #class_eval build instance methods themselves.

5. What is the difference between a singleton class and a singleton method?
Singleton classes are where singleton methods live.
