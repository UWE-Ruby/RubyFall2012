Questions:
1. What is method_missing and how can it be used?
A: method_missing is called by Ruby whenever a message is sent to an object for which it doesn't have a method defined to capture that particular message.
It can be used to dynamically create methods at run time. For example you could capture method names sent to a mass converter class that matched /(\w+)_gram/ to handle milligram, decagram, etc.

2. What is and Eigenclass and what is it used for? Where Do Singleton methods live?
A: An Eigenclass, also called a singleton class, is an anonymous superclass for an object that Ruby creates on-the-fly to store variables and methods unique to that object.
Singleton methods live in that anonymous singleton class.

3. When would you use DuckTyping? How would you use it to improve your code?
A: DuckTyping is when you don't care what class you are dealing with, only what it is able to actually do. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then why should we care if it is in fact a duck?
   DuckTyping is handy for creating flexible code that is decoupled from your current problem domain. In other words, reusable code that won't break every time you add a new feature.

4. What is the difference between a class method and an instance method? What is the difference between instance_eval and class_eval?
A: A class method lives in the Eigenclass of a class, whereas an instance method exists in the class itself.
   instance_eval defines class methods, while class_eval defines instance methods. Wierd, huh?

5. What is the difference between a singleton class and a singleton method?
A: A singleton class is the container for a singleton method.
