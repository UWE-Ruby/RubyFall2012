Please Read Chapters 23 and 24 DuckTyping and MetaProgramming

Questions:
1. What is method_missing and how can it be used?
I am still trying to wrap my head around this one but I think it's some sort of magical Ruby method that allows you to make dynamic methods on the fly while metaprogramming. I am unclear on practical basic usage.

2. What is and Eigenclass and what is it used for? Where Do Singleton methods live?
Singleton methods live in the class object referenced by the method. So if the object referenced is a String object then Ruby looks to this objects class and finds all the methods available to the String class.

3. When would you use DuckTypeing? How would you use it to improve your code?
Possibly when I don't know what an abject is but I have some intuitiona about what it can do.

4. What is the difference between a class method and an instance method? What is the difference between instance_eval and class_eval?
A class method is a method called on a class and an instance method is a method called on an instance of the class. 
I am confused about instance_eval and class_eval, I need further explainations.

5. What is the difference between a singleton class and a singleton method?
Singleton method is a method that belongs to a single object. A singleton class is a class for a single object.
