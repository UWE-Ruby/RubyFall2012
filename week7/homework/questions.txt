Questions:
1. What is method_missing and how can it be used?
It is a method that is called when there is no explicit receiver (ie. items.size) and no method defined. The missing_method will move up the superclass chain to find the method definition until it's been exhausted. 

2. What is and Eigenclass and what is it used for? Where Do Singleton methods live? Eigenclass is the anonymous class Ruby creates wihen a singleton method is written. Singleton methods live in an anonymous class, also referred to as a singleton class or eigenclass.

3. When would you use DuckTypeing? How would you use it to improve your code?
Duck Typing can be used whenever you feel comfortable with having flexibility. It's just a style of programming that isn't as explicit or rigid as others. It can be really helpful in simplifying code (in that you aren't using extra lines to define arguments or types that you don't necessarily need to) and being responsive to tests.

4. What is the difference between a class method and an instance method? What is the difference between instance_eval and class_eval?
A class method is available to within the class itself, whereas an instance method is available to an object being instantiated by the class.


5. What is the difference between a singleton class and a singleton method?
A singleton method is a method defined to one specific object. A singleton class is generated by Ruby to contain singleton methods (aka eigenclass).
