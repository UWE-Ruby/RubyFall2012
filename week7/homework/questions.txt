3. When would you use DuckTypeing? How would you use it to improve your code?
Ducktyping is used when the type of object you are using isn't necessary to the code you are producing.
It is very valuable for reusing objects and building flexible code.

4. What is the difference between a class method and an instance method? What is the difference between instance_eval and class_eval?
A class method is called from a singleton class and an instance method is from the class itself and derived from an instanciated object.
#instance_eval help builds class based methods (instance methods) and #class_eval build instance methods themselves.
