Rake is basically a task manager. Tasks can be written in Ruby to run Ruby programs. Prior to executing these tasks depedencies or prerequesites can be defined. Rake can be installed as a gem. I typically use rake in two ways. First I use rake to run the testing suite for the Rails app I work on, which, runs all of the tests for crucial aspects. Secondly I use rake to write my own tasks for testing HTML emails.
