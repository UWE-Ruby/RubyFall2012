1. How does Ruby read files?

Ruby reads files line-by-line using an IO object.

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?

File.open("my_output.txt","w") do |f|
	file.puts "Hello World!"
end

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?

(I assume this is the Dir class). Dir allows you to interact with directories on the system
that is running the Ruby code. You can change directories, list contents, and other similar
directory-related functions.

4. What is an IO object?

An IO object allows you to do much more with IO than puts/gets allows. Essentially, it allows two-way communication
with another resource. You can read an write from files, as 
well as interact with other servers and protocols across TCP/IP sockets.

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?

Rake is Make... but in Ruby. You can use it to automate certain "tasks" such as cleaning up
test instances, files, and automating other functionality. A task is a certain activity that you define, such as
"clean."
