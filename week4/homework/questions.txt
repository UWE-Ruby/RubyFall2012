1. How does Ruby read files?
Ruby reads files using the File class which is a subclass of IO.

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?
File.open("my_output.txt", "w") do |file|
	puts "Hello World!"
end

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?
The Dir class is a built in class of Ruby. It's used for navigating a directory structure in ruby. For example, moving to different directories, or getting directory listings. 

4. What is an IO object?
To quote from our text "An IO object is a bidirectional channel between a Ruby program and some external resource." That external resource can be a file, or a network resource or whatever. File and BasicSocket both subclass the IO base class. 

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
Rake is a build tool that is used for automating tasks such as manipulating files, running tests, compiling code, building a site. A rake task is a block of code that you've put together as one task. It seems like you want to put things that have common dependencies together in one task. But I think I have lot more to learn about what rake does.
