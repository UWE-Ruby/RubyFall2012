1. How does Ruby read files?
=> Ruby has an IO object that handles input and output, of which File is a child object. A file can be read by instantiating a File object and passing the filename as a parameter, then using a variety of methods and iterators to process the data as desired.

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?
=> File.open('this\is\the\path\to\my_output.txt',"w") do |file|
	file.print "Hello, world!"
end

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?
=> The Directory -- or Dir -- class gives a powerful way to navigate and manipulate directories and the contents thereof. It can be used in any situation where it would be useful to change or write to specific directories.

4. What is an IO object?
=> An IO object is a Ruby object that provides a convenient and safe interface for doing input and output in a variety of contexts, most commonly standard IO and files. File is a child class of IO.

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
