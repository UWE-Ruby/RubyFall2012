1. How does Ruby read files?
gets reads a line from standard input(or from any files specified on the command line when the script was invoked), and file.gets reads a line from the file object file.

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?
File.open("my_output.txt", "w") do |file|
  file.puts "Hello World!"
end
puts File.read("my_output.txt")

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?
Objects of class Dir are directory streams representing directories in the underlying file system. They provide a variety of ways to list directories and their contents.
The directory used in these examples contains the two regular files (config.h and main.rb), the parent directory (..), and the directory itself (.).

4. What is an IO object?
Ruby defines a single base class, IO, to handle input and output. An IO object is a bidirectional channel between a Ruby program and some external resource.

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
Rake is a software task management tool. It allows you to specify tasks and describe dependencies as well as to group tasks in a namespace.
A Task is the basic unit of work in a Rakefile. Tasks have associated actions(possibly more than one) and a list of prerequisites. When invoked, a task will first ensure that all of its prerequisites have an opportunity to run and then it will execute its own actions.
