1. How does Ruby read files?
    In the manner you specify - you can go byte-by-byte, line-by-line, or place the entire file contents
    into a string or array of strings.
2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?
    File.open("my_output.txt", "w") do |file|
        file.puts "Hello World!"
    end
    
3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?
    It is a class representing directories in the file system of the host computer, and it provides ways
    to manipulate, create, and list the contents of those directories.
    
4. What is an IO object?
    An IO object is simply a two-directional data stream.  It is the generic class that handles working
    with files and sockets.  The IO class is subclassed by File and Socket, but ultimately those are both
    treated as bidirectional data channels - hence, the IO parent class.
    
5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
    Rake is the tool used to run Ruby's makefiles (basically, an automated compiler/project builder).
    A task is somewhat akin to a function in a Rakefile - it contains a subset of instructions, and can
    list dependencies (and likewise, can be a dependency for another task).  You can use Rake tasks to handle
    the sort of functionality that are covered by small scripts on cron schedules in other languages - and
    the rake tasks themselves can be scheduled on cron!
