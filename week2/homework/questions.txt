Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
An array holds a collection of object references by positions. A hash is the same but you can index by more than numbers, you can index by any object type. 
2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
An array would work if you have a simple list that you want to reference by a number and perform functions related to a numbered list. A hash would be better if it's less of an ordered list but a key value pair of the same or disparate object types.
3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
Modules are a way of grouping together methods, classes and constants. Modules give you two major benefits 1) a namespace and prevent name clashes 2) they support the mixin functionality.Enumerable is a mixin that allows custom classes to have host methods standard to ru
by.
4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
Yes, you inherit many things in Ruby, in fact it makes it so that your child class is tightly coupled with the parent class. What you can do is create a mixin that esentially creates a new module with all the methods of the parent.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?

A class is basically the function with it's set of methods that can be called in subclasses. A Module is a a way grouping together methods, classes and constants to avoid the inheritance problem that classes can have.
