Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
A hash is a collection of key-value pairs where an array is an indexed collection of an object (starting with 0)

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
You would use an array to store a list of values where you would store associated data in a hash

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is a collection of methods and constants and is similar to a class except it has no instances. The enumerable module is a bunch of methods that work with collections.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, but mixins can be used to provide "multiple-inheritance-like" functionality

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
Modules allows methods to be written that can be used across multiple classes but can not be inherited or generate instances.
Classes may generate instances (objects), and have per-instance state (instance variables), and may inherit from another class, but not from a module.
