1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
<<<<<<< HEAD

	The difference between a Hash and an Array is a Hash can be indexed with an object of any type, such as a symbol or strig whereas an array is indexed with a non-negative integer.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?

	An array is useful for storing a list of items where an index isn't necessary.  A hash would be used to store a collection of items with a descriptive index (key) for easier look-up later.  

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?

	A module groups together methods, classes and constants.  Enumerable is a collecton of classes with traversal and searching methods with the ability to sort.  

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?

	Ruby is a single-inheritance language.  Although you can use "mixins" and include a module within a  class definition to access to the module's instance methods.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?

	The difference between a Module and a Class is that a module cannot be instantiated.  A class may inherit from another class.  A module cannot inherit from anything.
=======
An array is an ordered list of items that are referenced by their index (order), a hash is a collection of items that can be referenced by a key and have no order.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
When the items have an inherent order I would use an array, when I want to reference the items in my collection by a name or key and their order does not matter I would use a hash.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is a way to group code that you can use across multiple classes. Enumerable is a Ruby module that provides collection functionality; iteration, searching, and sorting. It requires an implementation of the each method.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, multiple inheritance is not allowed in Ruby. You can include multiple modules if you wanted to mix-in different functionality into your code. Code that is related with a hierarchical nature should be subclassed (inherited). A class can only have 1 direct parent, but can have lots of ancestors.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A class can be instantiated into an object, a module cannot. A module is code that can be used across many classes.
