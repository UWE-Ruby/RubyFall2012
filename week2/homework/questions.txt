Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
    And Array is indexed with positive integers and a hash is a key value pair indexed by the key object
2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
    You'd want to use arrays when you need to iterate over the integer index. Hashes are better suited for storing and looking objects up with a key
3. What is a module?
    A module is a set of code that is separated by a namespace. Useful to avoid naming clashes
Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
    It's a mixin that defines many methods for iteration
4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby?
    No, you can only inherit from one base class
How could you get around this problem?
    You can include Mixins
5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
    A module is a namespace and isn't instantiated. It can define classes within it however. A class is instantiated
