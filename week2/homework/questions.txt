Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
<<<<<<< HEAD
Arrays use [] operator, hash uses {} (with key value pairs using # =>). Hashes store data in key-value pairs that can use any object as a key. (Arrays store in key-value pairs determined by index position [interger].)
	
2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
You would use an array when you simply want data stored in an indexed list. You would use a hash when you need flexibility to pair the value with a key of whatever variety you want to use.
	
3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
Modules group together methods, classes and constants. They prevent name clashes and support mixins. Enumberable is a module (a standard mixin?) that implements external iterators; allows iteration over two collections in parallel.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, restricted to single inheritance from one parent. A work around is to use mixins.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
Modules provide methods to multiple classes (functionality focused), cannot be instatiated. Classes create objects, are instantiated, use modules. 


HERS
An array is an ordered list of items that are referenced by their index (order), a hash is a collection of items that can be referenced by a key and have no order.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
When the items have an inherent order I would use an array, when I want to reference the items in my collection by a name or key and their order does not matter I would use a hash.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is a way to group code that you can use across multiple classes. Enumerable is a Ruby module that provides collection functionality; iteration, searching, and sorting. It requires an implementation of the each method.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, multiple inheritance is not allowed in Ruby. You can include multiple modules if you wanted to mix-in different functionality into your code. Code that is related with a hierarchical nature should be subclassed (inherited). A class can only have 1 direct parent, but can have lots of ancestors.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A class can be instantiated into an object, a module cannot. A module is code that can be used across many classes.
