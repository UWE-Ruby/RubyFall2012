Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?

Ruby does not support multiple inheritance. However, since a child class can inherit from more than one thing because of the inheritance hierarchy; a child class can inherit from a parent class which in turn may have inherited from its own parent class. Additionally, modules can be used to share functionality.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?

A Class can be instantiated. Modules can have contracts that may require inheriting classes to implement certain methods.
