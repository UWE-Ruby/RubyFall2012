Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
In the array, each object reference occupies a position by a non-nagative integer index.  In the hash, we can index a hash with objects of any type: symbols, strings, regular expressions, and so on.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
Using Array: When we want access any object in the array using an unique key;  Using Hash: Hash points an object to another object. Consider of assigning a certain "meaning" to a string. Each time you refer that string, it refers its "meaning".


3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
Modules are a way of grouping together methods, classes and constants.  You write an iterator called each, which returns the elemnts of your collection in turn.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
Ruby is single-inheritance language.  However, Ruby classes can include the funtionality of any number of mixins.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
a module can not be instantiated but a class can; a module has no inheritance but a class inherits behavior and can be base for inheritance.
