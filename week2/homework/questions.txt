Q1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?

A1. Hashes and arrays are both indexed collections of objects, however, while an array is indexed by non-negative integers, a hash
is indexed by other objects referred to as keys. Symbols are often used as keys.

Q2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?

A2. Arrays are useful when you just need an ordered list or a collection of objects. Hashes are better for when you need to have a name or some
useful reference to these objects, such as for configuration variables or other settings.

Q3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?

A3. A module is a portable set of methods that can be imported into a specific class. Enumerable is a module that allows you to add various collection iteration methods 

Q4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?

A4. No; you must use mixins.

Q5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?

A5. Classes define a set of objects, an object cannot not be initialized using a module.
