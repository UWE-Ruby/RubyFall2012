Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
An array is a list of object references that uses an integer-based indexing system.  A Hash is the same thing, but instead can use any type of variable to index with, not just integers.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
Arrays are useful for data that should get iterated through linearly or categorized numerically.  Hashes are best for cases where the data needs to get categorized 

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is a collection of methods and classes, used to avoid namespace conflicts and for mixins.  Enumerable is a module that, when used as a mixin, provides your class with some very useful enumeration methods.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, at least not like in C++.  In Ruby you'd use a mixin, which mixes in the functions of another module with the class's.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A class is a collection of variables and methods, which can inherit variables/methods from other classes, and can similarly be inherited from.  Modules don't support inheritance, but instead exist mainly to avoid naming conflicts and to be used as for mixins.
