Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
<<<<<<< HEAD
An array is a list of object references that uses an integer-based indexing system.  A Hash is the same thing, but instead can use any type of variable to index with, not just integers.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
Arrays are useful for data that should get iterated through linearly or categorized numerically.  Hashes are best for cases where the data needs to get categorized 

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is a collection of methods and classes, used to avoid namespace conflicts and for mixins.  Enumerable is a module that, when used as a mixin, provides your class with some very useful enumeration methods.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, at least not like in C++.  In Ruby you'd use a mixin, which mixes in the functions of another module with the class's.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A class is a collection of variables and methods, which can inherit variables/methods from other classes, and can similarly be inherited from.  Modules don't support inheritance, but instead exist mainly to avoid naming conflicts and to be used as for mixins.
=======
An array is an ordered list of items that are referenced by their index (order), a hash is a collection of items that can be referenced by a key and have no order.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
When the items have an inherent order I would use an array, when I want to reference the items in my collection by a name or key and their order does not matter I would use a hash.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is a way to group code that you can use across multiple classes. Enumerable is a Ruby module that provides collection functionality; iteration, searching, and sorting. It requires an implementation of the each method.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, multiple inheritance is not allowed in Ruby. You can include multiple modules if you wanted to mix-in different functionality into your code. Code that is related with a hierarchical nature should be subclassed (inherited). A class can only have 1 direct parent, but can have lots of ancestors.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A class can be instantiated into an object, a module cannot. A module is code that can be used across many classes.
