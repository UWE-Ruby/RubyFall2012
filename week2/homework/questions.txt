Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
A hash is a non-ordered collection of objects, indexed via a key value that need not (and usually is not) an integer. An array on the other hand is a numerally-indexed collection.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
Collections requiring some sort of order are ideal for being placed into an array, whereas a hash is best for collections whose members are referenced by a category (e.g. name: Price Hardman).

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is code intended to be used by many classes. Modules have many advantages including namespaces, which can keep large programs from getting messy/buggy with regard to variable and method names. Enumerable is a module that provides the ability to traverse and manipulate collections.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
Ruby only supports single inheritance. The workaround to this is using modules (of which you can include multiple in a class).

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A module defines a namespace in which classes, methods, and constants can be defined. Whereas classes define functionality that can be inherited from parent classes and passed down to child classes, modules define functionality that can included across classes.
