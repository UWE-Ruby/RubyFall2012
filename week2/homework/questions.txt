1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?

A Hash is an ordered collection, while an array is a collection of key-values. An array returns the object at an index (for instance array = [2, 5, 8, 3, 4]; array[2] => 8) while a hash returns the value associated with a key (for instance hash = { george: "harrison", john: "lennon", paul: "mccartney", ringo: "starr" }; hash[:john] => "lennon")

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?

An array is ideal to use when the order of elements is important, hashes are better for storing a collection of elements which might naturally all have keys associated with them.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?

A module is a way of grouping classes, methods, and constants, so that you can access them with other objects. Using modules helps keep code DRY. Enumerable is a collection of methods (like inject) that you can incorporate as needed in other code.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?

A class can only inherit from one other class, but you can mix in module functions all night long.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?

A module is used to provide collections of methods to objects while classes are used to construct objects.
