Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?

	The difference between a Hash and an Array is a Hash can be indexed with an object of any type, such as a symbol or strig whereas an array is indexed with a non-negative integer.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?

	An array is useful for storing a list of items where an index isn't necessary.  A hash would be used to store a collection of items with a descriptive index (key) for easier look-up later.  

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?

	A module groups together methods, classes and constants.  Enumerable is a collecton of classes with traversal and searching methods with the ability to sort.  

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?

	Ruby is a single-inheritance language.  Although you can use "mixins" and include a module within a  class definition to access to the module's instance methods.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?

	The difference between a Module and a Class is that a module cannot be instantiated.  A class may inherit from another class.  A module cannot inherit from anything.
