## My Answers

Q1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?

A1. Hashes and arrays are both indexed collections of objects, however, while an array is indexed by non-negative integers, a hash
is indexed by other objects referred to as keys. Symbols are often used as keys.

Q2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?

A2. Arrays are useful when you just need an ordered list or a collection of objects. Hashes are better for when you need to have a name or some
useful reference to these objects, such as for configuration variables or other settings.

Q3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?

A3. A module is a portable set of methods that can be imported into a specific class. Enumerable is a module that allows you to add various collection iteration methods 

Q4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?

A4. No; you must use mixins.

Q5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?

A5. Classes define a set of objects, an object cannot not be initialized using a module.

## UWE Answers

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
An array is an ordered list of items that are referenced by their index (order), a hash is a collection of items that can be referenced by a key and have no order.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
When the items have an inherent order I would use an array, when I want to reference the items in my collection by a name or key and their order does not matter I would use a hash.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is a way to group code that you can use across multiple classes. Enumerable is a Ruby module that provides collection functionality; iteration, searching, and sorting. It requires an implementation of the each method.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, multiple inheritance is not allowed in Ruby. You can include multiple modules if you wanted to mix-in different functionality into your code. Code that is related with a hierarchical nature should be subclassed (inherited). A class can only have 1 direct parent, but can have lots of ancestors.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A class can be instantiated into an object, a module cannot. A module is code that can be used across many classes.
