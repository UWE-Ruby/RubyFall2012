Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
<<<<<<< HEAD
Both are a collection of objects that are indexed, an array is indexed with integers while a hash is indexed with any object (symbols, strings, regular expressions, etc)

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
Use a hash when you want to obtain an object by referencing an object (example, items in a purse: lipstick, wallet, etc) while an array is an ordered collection that is referenced linearly (0, 1, 2, 3)

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is a way of grouping together methods, classes, and constants. They provide a namespace, prevent name clashes, and supports the mixin facility. 

Enumerable: applies a function or operation to all items, since it runs through all objects you are able to use min/max/sort. Seems to be a simple way to evaluate all items instead of running through a loop.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, but you can use mixin modules to include subsets of information

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A module contains methods and logic but does not retain information. A class contains objects while a module is not an object.
=======
An array is an ordered list of items that are referenced by their index (order), a hash is a collection of items that can be referenced by a key and have no order.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
When the items have an inherent order I would use an array, when I want to reference the items in my collection by a name or key and their order does not matter I would use a hash.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is a way to group code that you can use across multiple classes. Enumerable is a Ruby module that provides collection functionality; iteration, searching, and sorting. It requires an implementation of the each method.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, multiple inheritance is not allowed in Ruby. You can include multiple modules if you wanted to mix-in different functionality into your code. Code that is related with a hierarchical nature should be subclassed (inherited). A class can only have 1 direct parent, but can have lots of ancestors.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A class can be instantiated into an object, a module cannot. A module is code that can be used across many classes.
