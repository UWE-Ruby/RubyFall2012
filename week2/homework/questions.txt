Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?

A hash can use any type of object as an index, an array just uses numbers.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?

I would use arrays for storing objects when the order of the objects is important, for example storing the words of a sentence. I would use hashes to associate different objects with each other, for example Eyes with Vision, Ears with Hearing, etc.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?

A module is a set of methods, classes and constants. The Enumerable module allows us to use an object's each method to step through and process the objects in a collection--it reminds me of using recursion.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?

Ruby objects can only inherit from one class, but we can get around this using mixins.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?

Classes can be instantiated as objects, modules cannot. Modules therefore are not a good fit for maintaining state.
