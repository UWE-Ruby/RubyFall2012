Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
<<<<<<< HEAD
Arrays are indexed by integers as keys. Hashes are similar to associative arrays in that the index does not need to be integers as keys. Instead the Hash keys can be symbols, strings, objects, regular expressions, etc.
2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
They both can be used in situations where you're required
to calculate the number of times a word is repeated in sentence.
Arrays can used when you need to break strings of words into a list, from
there Hashes can be used to build a count for each work by using the
words and indexes while the count as the value.
3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
Modules are a way to group methods, classes, and constants together.
Enumerable is a standard mixin in Ruby that allows the implementation
of various methods in terms of the classes method.
4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, ruby is a single-inheritance language, however you can get around
this by using mixins.
5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A module allows method with the same name to operate in the same program
by the use of :: scope resolution operator.
=======
An array is an ordered list of items that are referenced by their index (order), a hash is a collection of items that can be referenced by a key and have no order.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
When the items have an inherent order I would use an array, when I want to reference the items in my collection by a name or key and their order does not matter I would use a hash.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is a way to group code that you can use across multiple classes. Enumerable is a Ruby module that provides collection functionality; iteration, searching, and sorting. It requires an implementation of the each method.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, multiple inheritance is not allowed in Ruby. You can include multiple modules if you wanted to mix-in different functionality into your code. Code that is related with a hierarchical nature should be subclassed (inherited). A class can only have 1 direct parent, but can have lots of ancestors.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A class can be instantiated into an object, a module cannot. A module is code that can be used across many classes.
