Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
Both are a collection of objects that are indexed, an array is indexed with integers while a hash is indexed with any object (symbols, strings, regular expressions, etc)

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
Use a hash when you want to obtain an object by referencing an object (example, items in a purse: lipstick, wallet, etc) while an array is an ordered collection that is referenced linearly (0, 1, 2, 3)

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is a way of grouping together methods, classes, and constants. They provide a namespace, prevent name clashes, and supports the mixin facility. 

Enumerable: applies a function or operation to all items, since it runs through all objects you are able to use min/max/sort. Seems to be a simple way to evaluate all items instead of running through a loop.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, but you can use mixin modules to include subsets of information

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A module contains methods and logic but does not retain information. A class contains objects while a module is not an object.
