	A symbol is a string that uses the same space in memory.  A symbol is also a constant name that does not have to be predeclared and are guaranteed to be unique. 

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?

	A block is a piece of code that can be associated to method invocation.  The block is the code between two curly braces or a do and an end.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?

	A block can be passed to a method by putting the block at the end of the source line containing the method call.  Methods with parameters appear before the block.

	The method signature is a combination of the method name and its parameters.

5. Where would you use regular expressions?

	Regular expressions can be used for matching strings with patterns, changing strings with patterns, negative matching, repetition of chaacters or patterns, grouping, subsitution, and replacement to name a few.
