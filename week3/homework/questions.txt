1. What is a symbol?

Symbols are constant names that are immutable. You use them as a label or name for something that will not change
and that you need to use many times. Symbols save space in memory because a symbol only takes up one place in memory
and ruby reuses that symbol or name every time you call it. They are commonly used as hash keys because you use the
same hash key name over and over but you only really need one reference to it.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
String are mutable, you can change them or append to them, but symbols are constant, you cannot change their name,
otherwise it creates a new symbol and/or throws an error. Strings usually hold a value but symbols are more of a label
or a pointer/name that references some place in memory, for reuse.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is just ruby code found between curly braces or a do/end pair. You call a block with the yield keyword inside of a method.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
You pass a block to a method using the yield keyword and by calling the method with the block right after the method signature.

def myMethod
  // some ruby code
  yield
end

myMethod { puts "hello" * 3 }

gives you

// soem ruby code
hello hello hello

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
You would use regular expressions when searching or comparing a string against some value. For example, if you had a sentence that
said "I took the dog to the park" and you wanted to know if the string contained the word "dog" you would use a regular expression.
