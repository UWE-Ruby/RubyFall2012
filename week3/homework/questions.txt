1. What is a symbol?
<<<<<<< HEAD
An identifier that represents a name or string.  It has both an integer representation and a string representation.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
Strings are always a variable of type string; symbols are references that can be represented by a string.  Symbols are immutable, and strings are not.  Strings have access to all the string class methods, symbols do not.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is a chunk of code.  It is enclosed either by curly braces or do end.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
You put blocks directly after an invocation of a method, and pass in arguments by putting them in between vertical
bars: like so: do | arg1, arg2 | ... end

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
Regular expressions are for searching for a certain pattern within a string.  This is useful for finding/replacing,
extracting parts of a string, and testing whether a string meets a certain pattern.
=======
A symbol is a static name or identifier.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
A string is a collection of characters whereas a string is a static identifier. A string is not static no matter what the contents of the string are. So the strings "hello" and "hello" are two different ojects, whereas the symbol :hello and :hello are the exact same object. If you think of 1 as a FixNum or fixed number, you can think of the symbol :hello as the "FixStr" or fixed string :hello.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is an anonymous function, or some code snipt that you can define and then call at a later time. To call a block you can use the yield keyword.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
To pass a block to a method you define the block after the method call with either the curly bracket enclosure {} or the do/end syntax. An example of passing a block to the each method of an array:

my_array.each {|a| puts a}

Any method in Ruby can take a block. You can explicitly add a block to a method by putting an ampersand & before the variable name in the method definition. An example of this would be:

def my_method(&my_block)
	my_block.call
end

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
Regular expressions are used for pattern matching and replacement with strings. An example would be if I wanted to write a syntax checker for some text that checked if each sentance ended with a period, started with a space and then a capital letter.
