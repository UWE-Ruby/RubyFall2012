Q1. What is a symbol?

A1. A symbol is a constant that has a consistent name.

Q2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?

A2. A symbol is a consistent object, that is guarenteed to be unique. A string is a changeable object.

Q3. What is a block and how do I call a block?

A3. A block of a chunk of code that contains the variables when it was initialized. You can call a block by `yield`
or Proc::call.

Q4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?

A4. At the end of the method call between curly brackets, such as do_this_for_reals { block here }, which can then be called with yield.
If you'd rather pass in a proc, method_name(arg1, argv2, &proc)

Q5. Where would you use regular expressions?

A5. Where wouldn't you use a regular expression? They're useful to match patterns, 
pull specific chunks of strings that match patterns out, and all sorts of other such
tidbits. Not to mention substitution!
