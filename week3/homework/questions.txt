1. What is a symbol?

An identifier corresponding to a string of characters, often a name.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
Multiple symbols representing a single value have the same object id whereas
multiple values of the same string have different object ids.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A code block is a set of Ruby statements and expressions between braces or
a do/end pair.  A block can only appear after a method invocation.  The
code block can be called using the yield keyword and parameters passed
to yield will be assigned to arguments in the block.  A block is also
a closure and remembers the context in which it was defined.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
You can pass a block to a method by creating a proc object.  The method
signature includes an ampersand argument for the proc variable.

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
You can use a regex to test a string to see whether it matches a pattern.
You can extract from a string sections that match all or part of a pattern or
you can change the string, replacing parts that match a pattern.
