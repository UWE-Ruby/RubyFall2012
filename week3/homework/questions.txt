1. What is a symbol?
A symbol is like as string but it is immutable. It can't change once it is created. This makes it better to use a symbol for program control compared to a string which is good for data that may change. 
2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
A symbol is immutable, a string can change. A symbol is represented once in memory even when the symbol is repeated multiple times, when the same string is repeated each one is it's own object. 

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is a chunk of code that is enclosed in {} or sandwiched between do and end. You call a block from within a method using 'yield'

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
You pass a block to a method by putting the block after the method call. A method signature is a string representation of a method including a method's name and its parameters. 

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
You'd use regular expressions to evaluate whether a string follows a certain pattern. For example is a date in the format mm:dd:yyyy? Is your new password complicated enough? Is the string passed in to the method as an argument something the method knows how to deal with?
