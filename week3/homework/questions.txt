1. What is a symbol?

an object with a name that typically represents piece of information or a concept

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?

-symbols are immutable and strings are mutable
-symbol literals with unique names all point to the same object in memory
-symbols lack many of the methods of strings


3. What is a block and how do I call a block?

A block is a chunk of code contained between braces or between the terms do and end. You can call a block by using yield.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?

method signature is & (ampersand) and the name of the variable.

5. Where would you use regular expressions?

-when you want to test a string to see whether or not it matches a pattern
-when you want to extract sections from a string that either matches all of a pattern or only part of a pattern.
-when you want to change parts of the string that match the pattern
