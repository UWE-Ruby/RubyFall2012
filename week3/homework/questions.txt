1. What is a symbol?
     A symbol is superficially similar to a string, but in reality is a constant and immutable
     object.  They are useful as names and identifiers, and commonly serve as hash keys.
2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
     Strings can be modified, and multiple string objects can have the same contents and still be
     different objects. Symbols, however, cannot be modified ( like a frozen string in this regard), and
     the same symbol always refers to the same object.  :test and :test have the same object ID, while
     "test" and "test" would not.
3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
     A block is an arbitrary chunk of Ruby code that can be supplied to an existing method call. It is called
     by using a do-end following a method call(or curly brackets if the block is only one line)
4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
     The method itself must be written to account for blocks - either by testing for the presence of a
     supplied block and changing its flow based upon the result, or by being written to always expect
     a block.  At the point of method execution where the block should be started, it can be called
     with the Yield signature and the appropriate number of arguments.
5. Where would you use regular expressions?
     Regular expressions are useful for input parsing (e.g., ensuring a supplied email address is a valid
     one).  They can be used to strip undesirable characters from a string, or search a block of text
     to find any instances of a search term.
