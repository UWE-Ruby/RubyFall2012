1. What is a symbol?
An identifier that represents a name or string.  It has both an integer representation and a string representation.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
Strings are always a variable of type string; symbols are references that can be represented by a string.  Symbols are immutable, and strings are not.  Strings have access to all the string class methods, symbols do not.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is a chunk of code.  It is enclosed either by curly braces or do end.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
You put blocks directly after an invocation of a method, and pass in arguments by putting them in between vertical
bars: like so: do | arg1, arg2 | ... end

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
Regular expressions are for searching for a certain pattern within a string.  This is useful for finding/replacing,
extracting parts of a string, and testing whether a string meets a certain pattern.
