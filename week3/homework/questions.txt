1. What is a symbol?
A symbol is an identifier corresponding to a string of characters, often a name. 
2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
A string can also hold binary information and is of the String class, and therefore has all it's methods. 
3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is a set of Ruby statements and expressions between bracers or a do/end pair. You first invoke the block and then use the do or { followed by the block arguments.
4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
Normally you call the block to the method using yield. def double(p1)\n	yield(p1*2)\n	end. A method signature tells you the name of the method and its arguements. 
5. Where would you use regular expressions?
You would use them for patten matching (and subsequent actions) against a string.
