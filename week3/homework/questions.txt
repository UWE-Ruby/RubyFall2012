1. What is a symbol?
A symbol is an identifier that relates to a string which is usually a name. This identifier can then have values assigned to it. The name of a symbol can not change (is immutable).

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
As symbol reference is not able to be changed and it retains it's object_id (and place in memory), where a string is mutable and receives a new object_id each time it's changed

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is a closure which takes a chunk of code and itâ€™s variables and stores it for execution later.
You call a block by calling "yield".

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
You pass a block to a method by using the curly braces. The method signature allow you to pass parameters into a block

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
You use regular expressions to perform pattern-matching and "search-and-replace" functions on text.
