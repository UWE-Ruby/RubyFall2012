 - Chapter 22 The Ruby Language: basic types (symbols), variables and constants

1. What is a symbol?
	A constant name that you don't have to predeclare and that is guaranteed to be unique.
	They start with a : and with a name.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
	A string is just any string of characters that's enclosed by a string delimiter. 

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
	It's a chunk of code that can be associted with method invoactions, almost as if they were parameters. 
	To call it, you put the start of the block at the end of the source line containing the method call.  like:  rando_method {puts "I'm a block"}
	The method invokes the block by calling YIELD. 
	Delimiters can be either { } or DO... END.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
	I'm not sure how this question differes from #3. 

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
	If you need to match a string against a pattern.
	If you would like to do a "find and replace" sort of thing.
