1. What is a symbol?
A Ruby symbol is an identifier corresponding to a string of characters, often a name.  You construct the symbol for a name by preceding the name with a colon.  Substitution occurs in double-quoted strings.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
Multiple symbols representing a single value are unique whereas this is not true with strings. 


3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is simply a chunk of code enclosed between either braces or the keywords do and end. 
The block is being called by the each method once for each element in the array.  The element is passed to the block as the value parameter.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
Blocks can appear in Ruby source code only immediately after the invocation of some method.  If the method takes parameters, the block appears after these parameters.


5. Where would you use regular expressions?
You can test a string to see whether it matches a pattern.
You can extract from a string the sections that match all or part of a pattern.
You can change the string, replacing parts that match a pattern.
