1. What is a symbol?
a :symbol is a constant that doesn't have to be pre-declared and are always unique. 

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
A string is collection of characters and are String Obj. Symbols are constants that always have the same value and strings are meant to be changeable. 

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is code called usually for iterating over a list either within curly braces {} or several statements starting with do and then finaly end.  For example calling string.each{|s| puts s} will print out each char in the stringin the var "string".  

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
To pass a block to a method you use the yield statement.
The method signature is what Ruby stores away about a method before calling it the first time. 

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
One reason to use a regex would be to find a string by matching exactly ,within a larger string and then doing something like substituing or another operation on the string found.  Regex are really good for editing windows infs and other config files that have a structure like a hash as in Key=value.  ie. DriverDate=10/26/2012
