1. What is a symbol?
"an identifier corresponding to a string of characters, often a name"

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
A symbol is identified with a preceding colon rather than quotation marks for strings. Symbols are better when you want to create a  single word/name value that isn't arbitrary as opposed to a string variable that could have multiple values.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
Code that is enclosed by braces or "do" and "end". It is different from a method in that it is anonymous as opposed to being named/defined.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? 
Write the block immediately after invocation of a method

What is the method signature?
The components of a method that include the name of the method and applicable parameters; this lets you know how to call a method and helps the interpreter/compiler/parser/etc. know the difference between one method versus another. 

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
Everywhere! Particularly when trying to find text or assign text to variables.
