1. What is a symbol?
Constant names are not predeclared and are always unique

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
A symbol is immutable and is not garbage collected.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A bit of code delcared between key works(do...end) or in {}.  Blocks can be used to pass lambdas and other anonymous methods to methods as arguements.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
You can pass a block into a method using do...end or {}.  The block is then called with yield.  Another way is to pass it as a parameter with the ampersand.  It is then called in the method with #call.

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
Regular expressions are best used to match Strings.  This can help test certain return cases or supply boolean values if a String contains a certain set of characters.
