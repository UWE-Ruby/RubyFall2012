 - Chapter 22 The Ruby Language: basic types (symbols), variables and constants

1. What is a symbol?
<<<<<<< HEAD
a :symbol is a constant that doesn't have to be pre-declared and are always unique. 

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
A string is collection of characters and are String Obj. Symbols are constants that always have the same value and strings are meant to be changeable. 

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is code called usually for iterating over a list either within curly braces {} or several statements starting with do and then finaly end.  For example calling string.each{|s| puts s} will print out each char in the stringin the var "string".  

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
To pass a block to a method you use the yield statement.
The method signature is what Ruby stores away about a method before calling it the first time. 

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
One reason to use a regex would be to find a string by matching exactly ,within a larger string and then doing something like substituing or another operation on the string found.  Regex are really good for editing windows infs and other config files that have a structure like a hash as in Key=value.  ie. DriverDate=10/26/2012

=======
A symbol is a static name or identifier.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
A string is a collection of characters whereas a string is a static identifier. A string is not static no matter what the contents of the string are. So the strings "hello" and "hello" are two different ojects, whereas the symbol :hello and :hello are the exact same object. If you think of 1 as a FixNum or fixed number, you can think of the symbol :hello as the "FixStr" or fixed string :hello.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is an anonymous function, or some code snipt that you can define and then call at a later time. To call a block you can use the yield keyword.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
To pass a block to a method you define the block after the method call with either the curly bracket enclosure {} or the do/end syntax. An example of passing a block to the each method of an array:
>>>>>>> f7e675fa7a88f9cdfc4b342f33e2567d897b5075

my_array.each {|a| puts a}

Any method in Ruby can take a block. You can explicitly add a block to a method by putting an ampersand & before the variable name in the method definition. An example of this would be:

def my_method(&my_block)
	my_block.call
end

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
Regular expressions are used for pattern matching and replacement with strings. An example would be if I wanted to write a syntax checker for some text that checked if each sentance ended with a period, started with a space and then a capital letter.
