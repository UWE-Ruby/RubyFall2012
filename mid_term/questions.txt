Instructions for Mid-Term submission and Git Review (10pts):
 - Create a git repository for your answers
 - Add and Commit as you work through the questions and programming problems
 - Your git log should reflect your work, don't just commit after you have finished working
 - Use .gitignore to ignore any files that are not relevant to the midterm
 - E-mail me your ssh public key
 - I will email you back with your repository name
 - Add a remote to your git repository: git@nird.us:RubyFall2012/YOURREPOSITORYNAME.git

 Questions (20pts):
 - What are the three uses of the curly brackets {} in Ruby?
	Three cases when curly brackets are used are for making hashes, when denoting blocks instead of do...end, 
	
 - What is a regular expression and what is a common use for them?
	Regular expressions are a set of constants and operator symbols that operate over sets of strings. They are commonly used for matching patterns within a String. This can include seeing if the pattern exists in a String, extracting all or partial matched portions of a pattern from a string, and changing the string by replacing the parts that match the pattern.
	
 - What is the difference between how a String, a symbol, a FixNum, and a Float are stored in Ruby?
	
 - Are these two statements equivalent? Why or Why Not?
   1. x, y = "hello", "hello"
   2. x = y = "hello"

	These two statements are equivalent in that statement 1. stores 
	
- What is the difference between a Range and an Array?
	A range is a interval of a set of values from start to end (1,2,3...a,b,c,d) where an Array could be any set of values and not necessarily in an particular order (d,v,e,d....3,4,2,5,1). 
	
- Why would I use a Hash instead of an Array?
	A Hash would be used over an Array when you need to find items based of key-value pairs. Arrays are good when you need to iterate over a set that is in particular order.
	
- What is your favorite thing about Ruby so far?
	
	
- What is your least favorite thing about Ruby so far?
	My least favorite thing in Ruby so far is Blocks. This is probably do to the fact that I don't fully understand it yet and have not capitalized on its use case.
 
 Programming Problems (10pts each):
 - Write a passing rspec file called even_number_spec.rb that tests a class called EvenNumber.
    - The EvenNumber class should:
       - Only allow even numbers
       - Get the next even number
       - Compare even numbers
       - Generate a range of even numbers
- Make the rspec tests in wish_list_spec.rb pass by writing a WishList class
   - The WishList class should:
      - Mixin Enumerable
      - Define each so it returns wishes as strings with their index as part of the string

Mid-Term Spec (50pts):
- Make the tests pass.
