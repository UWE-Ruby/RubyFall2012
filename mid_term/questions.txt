Instructions for Mid-Term submission and Git Review (10pts):
 - Create a git repository for your answers
 - Add and Commit as you work through the questions and programming problems
 - Your git log should reflect your work, don't just commit after you have finished working
 - Use .gitignore to ignore any files that are not relevant to the midterm
 - E-mail me your ssh public key
 - I will email you back with your repository name
 - Add a remote to your git repository: git@nird.us:RubyFall2012/YOURREPOSITORYNAME.git
 - Push your changes to the remote
 - After 6pm Tuesday November 13th you will not be able to push to your remote repository (or clone).
 
 Questions (20pts):
 - What are the three uses of the curly brackets {} in Ruby?
		To create hashes
		To create blocks
		For string interpolation

 - What is a regular expression and what is a common use for them?
		Code that represents a string pattern that can be compared to an actual 
		string. The pattern might simply be one that contains numbers or certain 
		punctuation. A somewhat more complex pattern that is a common use, would be one 
		that represents an email address. 

 - What is the difference between how a String, a symbol, a FixNum, and a Float are stored in Ruby?

		Strings
		Strings are sequences of characters though they can also hold binary data. 
		They are objects of class String. 

		Symbols		
		Symbols, unlike Strings, are stored in memory once and are immutable.

		FixNums		
		FixNums are Integers within the range -2E62 to 2E62-1 and are stored in 
		binary form. When working with FixNums, you do not work with references to 
		the FixNum, you work directly with the object.

		For example, on my computer when comparing object_id's I find the following:

			x = 8
			8.object_id is 17
			x.object_id is also 17

		Floats
		Floats, in contrast to FixNums, are mutable. When working with Floats, you 
		are working with references.

 - Are these two statements equivalent? Why or Why Not?
   1. x, y = "hello", "hello"
   2. x = y = "hello"

		Yes, in that both x and y in either case will produce "hello". No, in that they are references to different objects. 

- What is the difference between a Range and an Array?
		Ranges have values that share a relationship amongst each other such as
		intervals, sequences, conditionals, or through relationships defined by a
		given class.

		Arrays are indexed allowing for random access. Arrays, unlike ranges, can be 
		populated by mixed-types.

- Why would I use a Hash instead of an Array?
		Use Hashes when indexes or associations are better suited with something 
		other than numbers such as symbols or strings. 

- What is your favorite thing about Ruby so far?
		Conciseness
		Plethora of documentation: detail-oriented bloggers, stackoverflow posts, 
			actual official documentation, etc.

- What is your least favorite thing about Ruby so far?
		Because it's so intuitive and does some of the thinking for you, it's easy 
			to feel like you're missing steps or it can be difficult to figure out if
			you did something wrong.
		I am both excited and overwhelmed by how many choices there are to do any
			one thing.
 
 Programming Problems (10pts each):
 - Write a passing rspec file called even_number_spec.rb that tests a class called EvenNumber.
    - The EvenNumber class should:
       - Only allow even numbers
       - Get the next even number
       - Compare even numbers
       - Generate a range of even numbers
- Make the rspec tests in wish_list_spec.rb pass by writing a WishList class
   - The WishList class should:
      - Mixin Enumerable
      - Define each so it returns wishes as strings with their index as part of the string

Mid-Term Spec (50pts):
- Make the tests pass.
