# Please make these examples all pass
# You will need to change the 3 pending tests
# You will need to write a passing test for the first example 
# 	(Hint: If you need help refer to the in-class exercises)
# The two tests with the pending keyword, require some ruby code to be written
# 	(Hint: You should do the reading on Strings first)
