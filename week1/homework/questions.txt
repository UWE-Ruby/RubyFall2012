Chapter 3 Classes, Objects, and Variables 
p.90-94 Strings

1. What is an object?
<<<<<<< HEAD
A is something created from a class constructor code.   myObj = object.new 

2. What is a variable?
A var is a container for a value ie, var = 1.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
Objects are created from a class and inherit the class properties.

4. What is a String?  
A set of chars in sequence or can also be a binary sequence.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
a.puts
b.spilt
c.concat
d.include

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? 
a. using a delimiter like % . 
b. using a multiline delimiter such as 
string = <<END_OF_STRING
line 1 of my string
line 2 of my string
line 3 of my string
<<END_OF_STRING

Bonus: What is the difference between the two? 
=======
An object is a representation in memory of a specific concept or thing that the Ruby interpreter knows about. 

2. What is a variable?
A variable is a name for a location in memory. It can contain, or point to, any type of object.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
An object is an instance of a class, or a specific thing of that class's type in memory. The class is the specifics that are common to all things of that type. The classification of a concept or a thing is a class. A specific thing or concept of a class's type in memory is an object. For example: All books have titles (Class). This book's title is "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" (Object). 

4. What is a String?
A string is how Ruby understands text. It is a collection of characters (Bytes), and can be created by making an instance of the String class (String.new) or as a string literal ("",'', %Q[]).

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
chomp! - removes newline characters, or the specified characters, from the end of a string
strip! - removes leading or trailing whitespace from a string
split  - returns an array of strings made up of the original string separated on whitespace or the specified characters or regexp

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?
Single quotes ex: '' and Double quotes ex: "". The single qoutes allow for 2 escape characters: \' and \\ . The double qouted string literal allows for many different escaped special characters (like \n is a line break) and allows for string interpolation, or the injection of evaluated Ruby code into the string ex: "Hello #{my_name}". The single qouted string takes up much less memory than a doulbe qouted string with interpolation. Without interpolation, both are about the same.
