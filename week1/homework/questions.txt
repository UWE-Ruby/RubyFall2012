5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal?
A: the two wasy of defing a string literal are by typing text between matching single quotes or double quotes.
Bonus: What is the difference between the two?
A: strings created using single quotes are typically interpretted literally, while strings created using double quotes use interpolation to allow variable content determined at run time to be inserted in the string before it is created. For example:

irb(main):018:0* "The year is: #{Time.now.year}."
=> "The year is: 2012."
irb(main):019:0> 'The year is: #{Time.now.year}.'
=> "The year is: \#{Time.now.year}."
