1. What is an object?
     An object is a single instance of a class.
2. What is a variable?
     A variable is a placeholder for a single object.
3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
     The class is the category that holds all of the objects. Objects are the things that make up a class.
4. What is a String?
     A string is a collection of characters.
5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
     "String".captialize
     "String".downcase
     "String".reverse
6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?     - A string literal is when a string is directly embedded into code, using quotation marks or using single quotation marks.
- The difference is the amount of processing that Ruby does. In the double-quoted instances, interpolation occurs and substitutions occur.
