p.90-94 Strings

1. What is an object?
<<<<<<< HEAD
	An object is an instance of a class that can be uniquely identified in which can be given it's own properties and actions.
2. What is a variable?
	Variables are references to objects in memory.
	 blocks of memory used to store data of different types. Depending the variables location in the code it can be seen by classes, objects, methods, and/or globally.
3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
	Objects are instances of classes
4. What is a String?
	In Ruby, Strings are objects of the class String that hold sequences of characters.
5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
	myString.split()
	myString.casecmp("someString")
	myString.chomp
6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?
	Two ways of defining a String literal are to use %q for delimited single quote Strings and %Q for double-quoted Strings.
=======
An object is a representation in memory of a specific concept or thing that the Ruby interpreter knows about. 

2. What is a variable?
A variable is a name for a location in memory. It can contain, or point to, any type of object.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
An object is an instance of a class, or a specific thing of that class's type in memory. The class is the specifics that are common to all things of that type. The classification of a concept or a thing is a class. A specific thing or concept of a class's type in memory is an object. For example: All books have titles (Class). This book's title is "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" (Object). 

4. What is a String?
A string is how Ruby understands text. It is a collection of characters (Bytes), and can be created by making an instance of the String class (String.new) or as a string literal ("",'', %Q[]).

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
chomp! - removes newline characters, or the specified characters, from the end of a string
strip! - removes leading or trailing whitespace from a string
split  - returns an array of strings made up of the original string separated on whitespace or the specified characters or regexp

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?
Single quotes ex: '' and Double quotes ex: "". The single qoutes allow for 2 escape characters: \' and \\ . The double qouted string literal allows for many different escaped special characters (like \n is a line break) and allows for string interpolation, or the injection of evaluated Ruby code into the string ex: "Hello #{my_name}". The single qouted string takes up much less memory than a doulbe qouted string with interpolation. Without interpolation, both are about the same.
