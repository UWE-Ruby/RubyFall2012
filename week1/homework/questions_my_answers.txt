An object is an instance of a class.

A variable is a pointer to an object.

According to http://blog.grayproductions.net/articles/ruby_19s_string, in Ruby 1.8 a string is a "collection of bytes" whereas in Ruby 1.9 a string is a "collection of encoded data" i.e. both a collection of bytes and an encoding object describing how to interpret them.
